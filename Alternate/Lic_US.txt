For the purposes of this Agreement, Program means both singular and plural when the Agreement is provided with more than one Program.

A “Proof of Entitlement” (“PoE”) is evidence of Your authorization to use a Program at a specified level. That level may be measured, for example, by the users. The PoE is also evidence of Your eligibility for future upgrade prices, if any, and potential special or promotional opportunities. If Lenovo does not provide You with a PoE, then Lenovo may accept the original paid sales receipt or other sales record from the party (either Lenovo or its reseller) from whom You acquired the Program, provided that it specifies the name of the Program and the usage level acquired.
 
“You” and “Your” refer either to an individual person or to a single legal entity.


This Agreement includes Part 1 - General Terms, Part 2 - Country-unique Terms (if any), Part 3 - Program-unique Terms, and Proof of Entitlement and is the complete agreement between You and Lenovo regarding the use of the Program.

If You wish to increase the level of use, notify Lenovo or the party from whom You acquired it and pay any applicable charges. 

If any authority imposes a duty, tax, levy or fee, excluding those based on Lenovo’s net income, upon the Program, then You agree to pay the amount specified or supply exemption documentation. You are responsible for any personal property taxes for the Program from the date that You acquire it.

Limitation of Liability (Section 4): The following replaces the terms of this section in its entirety: 

For the purposes of this section, a “Default” means any act, statement, omission, or negligence on the part of Lenovo in connection with, or in relation to, the subject matter of an Agreement in respect of which Lenovo is legally liable to You, whether in contract or tort. A number of Defaults which together result in, or contribute to, substantially the same loss or damage will be treated as one Default.

Circumstances may arise where, because of a Default, You are entitled to recover damages from Lenovo. This section sets out the extent of Lenovo’s liability and Your sole remedy.

1. Lenovo will accept unlimited liability for:

(a) death or personal injury caused by the negligence of Lenovo; 

(b) any breach of its obligations implied by Section 12 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 or Section 2 of the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982, or any statutory modification or re-enactment of either such Section; and

(c) subject always to the Items for Which Lenovo is Not Liable below, for physical damage to Your tangible property resulting from the negligence of Lenovo.

2. Lenovo’s entire liability for actual damages for any one Default will not in any event, except as provided in item 1 above, exceed the greater of 1) £75,000, or 2) 125% of the amount You paid for the Program directly relating to the Default. These limits also apply to Lenovo’s suppliers and Program developers. They state the maximum for which Lenovo and such suppliers and Program developers are collectively responsible.

Items for Which Lenovo is Not Liable

Save with respect to any liability referred to in item 1 above, under no circumstances is Lenovo or any of its suppliers or Program developers liable for any of the following, even if Lenovo or they were informed of the possibility of such losses:

1. loss of, or damage to, data;

2. special, indirect, or consequential loss; or

3. loss of profits, business, revenue, goodwill, or anticipated savings.
