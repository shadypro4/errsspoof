*     This flash under operating system (32-bit/64-bit) utility provides    *
*     the ability to update the system BIOS from a Windows application.     *
*                                                                           *

*     3.  In the "Command Prompt" window, change to the directory where the *
*         above files were extracted.  The command to go to the location is *
*         "cd C:\SWTOOLS\FLASH\xxxJYnnUSA", where "nn" represents the two   *
*         digit flash level.                                                *

*     4.  Enter the command "flash.cmd" and press the Enter key to start    *
*         the flashing process.                                             *

*     5.  You may first see a confirmation prompt "Proceed with BIOS        *
*         update now?". Click "Yes" to continue.                            *

*     6.  You will see the prompt "Would you like to update the Serial      *
*         Number?". Input "n" and press Enter.                              *

*     7.  Then you will see the prompt "Would you like to update the        *
*         Machine Type and Model?". Input "n" and press Enter again.        *
*         Then the BIOS update process will start.                          *
*                                                                           *
*     8.  The update may take up to 2 minutes. Do not power off or restart  *
*         the system during this procedure! After the Windows update        *
*         process ends, the system will automatically reboot to continue    *
*         the flash process.                                                *

*     9.  After the system reboots, the BIOS update process will continue   *
*         with a simple graphic UI. When the BIOS update process ends,      *
*         the system will reboot automatically.                             *

*                                                                           *
*     In order to flash back to an older level of BIOS, the following       *
*     steps should be used to insure the latest flash utility is used.      *
*                                                                           *
*     1.  Obtain the older level and latest level BIOS update programs      *
*         from the Lenovo website.                                          *
*     2.  Use the method described in section 3 to unpack the program into  *
*         "C:\SWTOOLS\FLASH\O2VJYnnUSA".                                    *
*     3.  Copy imageO2V.bin from the older BIOS update program folder,      *
*         paste it and replace the same file in the latest level BIOS       *
*         update program folder.                                            *
*     4.  In the latest level BIOS update program folder, run flash.cmd     *
*         to flash back to an older level BIOS.                             *
*                                                                           *

*                     5. Delaying Reboot in BIOS Update                     *
*                                                                           *
*     The BIOS update process consists of two phases. The first phase       *
*     happens in the OS. After the first flashing phase is complete, the    *
*     system will automatically reboot to perform the secondary             *
*     BIOS update phase.                                                    *
*                                                                           *
*     /sccm is designed for BIOS update deployment when the administrator   *
*     wants to manually control the system reboot after first BIOS phase    *
*     update has finished. With the parameter "/sccm", the system won't     *
*     reboot immediately after applying the first phase of the BIOS update. *
*     The administrator must SHUTDOWN the system later to trigger the       *
*     secondary phase of the BIOS update.                                   *
*                                                                           *
*     Important Notes:                                                      *
*                                                                           *
*     1. After the first phase of the BIOS update is complete, the          *
*        administrator must SHUTDOWN the system to trigger the secondary    *
*        phase. A reboot instead of a shutdown won't work.                  *
*     2. The shutdown mentioned in Note 1 must be an actual                 *
*        S5 (System Power Off). The default shutdown behavior in            *
*        modern OS (WIN8/WIN8.1/WIN10 etc.) is S4 (Hibernate). To change    *
*        these modern OS shutdown behavior to S5, you need to turn off      *
*        the "Fast Startup" from "Control Panel -> Power options". If your  *
*        deployment software supports S5 shutdown, you can send a sleep S5  *
*        command by software to trigger the secondary BIOS update phase.    *
*     3. If the system is not shut down using the S5 shutdown, the flash    *
*        process will not continue, and will need to be restarted from      *
*        phase 1.                                                           *
*                                                                           *
*     The following example shows how to use /sccm to implement first phase *
*     BIOS update with deployment software:                                 *
